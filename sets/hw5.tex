\item Problem 26 \\
Tri-state devices do not use tricimal arithmetic because the third ``state" is essentially an open circuit. Whereas a logical `0' still outputs some voltage, the `Z' or high-impedance state outputs nothing at all, removing the output from the circuit. The purpose of a tri-state device is to isolate a particular output from a circuit, allowing for multiple outputs to be connected to the same line. \\

Static-0: An output should be 0, but temporarily goes to a 1 as an input changes. \\
