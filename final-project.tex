\section{Design Specification}
\subsection{Project Description}
The scenario for this project describes a city in need of a traffic light control system for their busy intersection.
This project provides a system that satisfies the requirements for the intersection. The road running from North to South is a busy four-lane street with turn lanes,
while the road running from East to West is a small two-lane country road. To allow for optimal traffic flow through the intersection,
the traffic on the busy road is given priority unless there are cars waiting for a certain period of time on the small road or in the turn lanes.

\subsection{Constraints}
\emph{The timing for the controller is as follows:}\\[1cm]
The N-S signal is green by default.\\[5mm]
If there are cars waiting in the N-S turn lane for longer than 15 seconds, the N-S signal will cycle green~$\rightarrow$~yellow~$\rightarrow$~red, followed by the green arrow for 15 seconds.
The N-S signal finally cycles green~arrow~$\rightarrow$~yellow arrow~$\rightarrow$~green, and will stay green for at least 30 seconds.\\[5mm]
If there are cars waiting in the E-W turn lane for longer than 15 seconds, the N-S signal will cycle green~$\rightarrow$~yellow~$\rightarrow$~red, followed by the E-W green light for 15 seconds.
The E-W signal will then cycle green~$\rightarrow$~yellow~$\rightarrow$~red, after which the N-S signal turns green and will stay green for at least 30 seconds.
