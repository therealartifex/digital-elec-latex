\section{Design Specification}
The scenario for this project describes a city in need of a traffic light control system for their busy intersection. This project provides a system that satisfies the requirements for the intersection. The road running from North to South is a busy four-lane street with turn lanes, while the road running from East to West is a small two-lane country road. To allow for optimal traffic flow through the intersection, the traffic on the busy road is given priority unless there are cars waiting for more than fifteen seconds on the small road or in the turn lanes.
